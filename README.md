<h1 align="center">Birdwatching Globe</h1>

Here is our current Globe.GL example â€“ it is receiving information from a socket.io feed every 20 seconds
that displays the latitude and longitude of recent bird sightings:

Currently when a new set of points arrive, the previous set disappears.

<h5 align="left">Requested Updates:</h5>

We want to update the globe so that all past sightings in a 24-hour period are also displayed. The newest
sightings would continue to be yellow, and any older sightings would change color to a lighter white at
50% opacity, and slightly smaller than the new points. We have no need to store the old data beyond 24
hours.
The final applica9on will on display in a lobby on a single PC using a chrome kiosk.
We would need the final application no later than December 22, 2023.
